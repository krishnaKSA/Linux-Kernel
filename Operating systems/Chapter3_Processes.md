# **PROCESS :**
  * Process is more than the progranning code, which is sometimes knowns as the text section.
  * Process includes current activity, as represented by the value of **Program counter**, and contents of the processor registers.
  * A process generally includes the process **stack** , which contains temporary data variable, function arguments, return address),
    and a data section which includes global variable.
  * A process also includes heap , which is memory that is dynamically allocated during the process run time.

A program is a passive entity, such as a file containing a list of instructions stored on disk
(often called an executable file). In contrast, a process is an active entity, with a program counter specifying the next instruction to execute and a set of associated resources. A program becomes a process when an executable file is loaded into memory.

**The structure of the process is below.**
